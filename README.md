# THING-U: Note taking app

Simple react frontend for the note-taking Thing-U app, includes a basic todo-list with CRUD functionalities and a note dashboard inspired in Google Keep, for larger notes with posibility of uploading images, and editing the notes color, size and position.
If running this project locally, it relies on another repository for handling data backup that needs to run simultaneously. You can find it [here](https://github.com/ncamargop/note-taking-app-backend).
